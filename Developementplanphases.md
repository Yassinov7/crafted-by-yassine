3. Implement form validation
4. Add keyboard navigation support
5. Conduct user testing and gather feedback
6. Optimize database queries and API calls
7. Implement caching strategies

### Timeline
- Estimated: 3-4 days

## Technical Implementation Details

### Supabase Integration
- Use existing [supabase.js](file:///c:/Users/mohma/OneDrive/Desktop/Important/Portfolio/crafted-by-yassine/src/lib/supabase.js) client
- Implement proper error handling for all Supabase operations
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies as defined in database schema
- Implement real-time subscriptions where appropriate

### Storage Management
- Use existing `blog-covers` bucket for image uploads
- Implement proper file naming and organization
- Add image optimization and compression
- Handle file deletion when entities are removed

### Components & Architecture
- Reuse existing components where possible ([IntroSection](file:///c:/Users/mohma/OneDrive/Desktop/Important/Portfolio/crafted-by-yassine/src/components/layout/IntroSection.jsx), [PostForm](file:///c:/Users/mohma/OneDrive/Desktop/Important/Portfolio/crafted-by-yassine/src/components/admin/PostForm.jsx))
- Create new reusable components for dashboard UI elements
- Implement proper state management
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Database Schema Considerations

The current database schema supports all required functionality:
- `blog_posts` table for blog management
- `projects` table for project management
- `timeline_items` table for timeline management
- `categories` table for blog post categorization
- All tables have proper RLS policies for authenticated access

## Estimated Total Timeline
- **Minimum**: 24 days
- **Realistic**: 30-35 days
- **With buffer**: 40 days

## Success Criteria
1. All CRUD operations work correctly for all entity types
2. Proper error handling and user feedback
3. Responsive design that works on all device sizes
4. Adequate performance for typical usage scenarios
5. Comprehensive test coverage
6. Proper documentation for future maintenance
